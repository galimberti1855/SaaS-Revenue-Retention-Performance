# SaaS Revenue Retention Performance

just wrapped up a flagship Power BI project tackling a common SaaS challenge: How do you track growth without losing sight of retention?

Most dashboards show what happened. I built this to show why?

# Highlights:

- Retention Pulse: Dynamic combo chart linking MRR growth and Churn Rate—the ultimate subscription business “health check.”

- Efficiency Tracking: LTV:CAC ratios for a quick view of acquisition health.

- Interactive Navigation: 2-page app with easy switching between Executive Summary and detailed Customer Audit.

- Drill-Through: Right-click any data point to explore the raw customer data behind the numbers.
